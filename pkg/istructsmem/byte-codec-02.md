# Codec used to represent the structures in byte form

## Introduction

The application structures (records, events, representations) in the database are stored in the form of an array of bytes.
Codec — a set of algorithms for the presentation of stored structures in the form of bytes arrays used in a particular version of the application.

## Versions

Codec has its own version. Codec version number - a whole unsigned byte value (*byte*). The later version of Codec corresponds to a larger version number. The codec of one version can be used by the application of different versions. The application of any version should be able to record the data in the last (at the time of the application) of the Codec version, and read the data encoded by this or any earlier version of the Codec.

### Current codec version

The current version of the codec: `2` .

### Codec version changes summary

The storage of the plan of modified records *commandCUDs* has been changed.
In addition to changes in records, the plan of modified records contains information about emptied (cleared) fields.

## Record

Record *record* contains the Codec version *codecVer* and a data *rowData*.

`record = codecVer rowData .`

### Codec Version (record)

Codec version *codecVer* stored as an unsigned single byte number.

`codecVer = byte . // (0x00)`

### Row Data

Row data *rowData* contains the type name identifier *QNameID*, the values of the system fields *sysFields* and field values with user data *userFields*.

`rowData = QNameID [sysFields] [userFields] .`

If type name `QName` is not specified (i.e. equal to `appdef.NullQName`), then other members (*sysFields* и *userFields*) are omitted.

#### QName ID (record)

Type name identifier *QNameID* is stored as unsigned two-bytes number. Here and in the following, unless specifically stated, numerical values are recorded using a byte order from most significant to least significant. (`BigEndian`).

`QNameID = uint16 . // BigEndian`

#### System fields

❗ *Changed* compared to the previous version

System fields include the bit mask of system fields *sysFieldsMask*, the record identifier *sys.ID*, the owning record identifier *sys.ParentID*, the container *sys.Container*, and the activity indicator *sys.IsActive*.

`systemFields = sysFieldsMask [sys.ID] [sys.ParentID] [sys.Container] [sys.IsActive] .`

#### System fields mask

The system fields bit mask is an unsigned two-byte number, each set bit of which corresponds to the stored value of a system field.

| Bit | Mask | System field | Comment |
| --: | :---: | :------------- | ----------- |
|   0 | x0001 | sys.ID         | Record identifier is provided for documents (`CDoc`, `GDoc`, `ODoc`, `WDoc`) and for records (`CRecord`, `GRecord`, `ORecord`, `WRecord`) |
|   1 | x0002 | sys.ParentID   | The identifier of the owner entry (document) is provided for by the definitions of records (`CRecord`, `GRecord`, `ORecord`, `WRecord`). Some documents (`ODoc`) They also allow an indication of the identifier of the owner document if they are invested in the document |
|   2 | x0004 | sys.Container  | The container identifier is provided for records (`CRecord`, `GRecord`, `ORecord`, `WRecord`) and for objects (`Object`). Some documents (`ODoc`) also allow the container if they are nested into document |
|   3 | x0008 | sys.IsActive   | A sign of activity is provided for documents (`CDoc`, `GDoc`, `WDoc`) and records (`CRecord`, `GRecord`, `WRecord`) |

`buildError = valid [ ( messageLength [ messageBytes ] ) ( qNameLength [ qNameChars ] ) ( [ rawDataLength [ rawDataBytes ] ] ) ] .`

##### Valid Flag

The build success flag *valid* is recorded as a boolean value (1 byte).

###### Emptied Fields Indexes

❗ *New* in version

The list of indexes of emptied fields *emptiedFieldsIndexes* contains an array of unsigned two-byte numbers.

`emptiedFieldsIndexes = uint16 { uint16 } .`

The index of the field in the list of emptied fields corresponds to the index of the field in the list of *user* fields of the record. The first user field has an index of `0` (zero), the second - `1` (one), and so on.

## View Record Value

The structure of the representation record matches the structure of the [record](#record). However, in addition to fields with simple data (numbers, strings, bytes, etc.), representation records can contain user fields of complex types `appdef.DataKind_Record` and `appdef.DataKind_Event`. The values of fields of these types are stored inside *userFields* as byte arrays, the internal structure of which is defined above in the sections [Record](#record) and [Event](#event).
