// A Limiter controls how frequently events are allowed to happen.
// It implements a "token bucket" of size b, initially full and refilled
// at rate r tokens per second.
// Informally, in any large enough time interval, the Limiter limits the
// rate to r tokens per second, with a maximum burst size of b events.
// As a special case, if r == Inf (the infinite rate), b is ignored.
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket for more about token buckets.
//
// The zero value is a valid Limiter, but it will reject all events.
// Use NewLimiter to create non-zero Limiters.
//
// Limiter has three main methods, Allow, Reserve, and Wait.
// Most callers should use Wait.
//
// Each of the three methods consumes a single token.
// They differ in their behavior when no token is available.
// If no token is available, Allow returns false.
// If no token is available, Reserve returns a reservation for a future token
// and the amount of time the caller must wait before using it.
// If no token is available, Wait blocks until one can be obtained
// or its associated context.Context is canceled.
//
// The methods AllowN, ReserveN, and WaitN consume n tokens.
